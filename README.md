# ing.sb.storeManagement

Create an API that acts as a store management tool- Create a Github profile if you don't have one

- Write unit tests, at least for one class
- Optional: Implement a basic authentication mechanism and role based endpoint access

Done: 
- Use git in a verbose manner, push even if you wrote only one class
- Create a Java, maven based project, Springboot for the web part
- No front-end, you can focus on backend, no need to overcomplicate the structure
- Use Java 9+ features
- Add a small Readme to document the project
- Design error mechanism and handling plus logging
- Implement basic functions, for example: add-product, find-product, change-price or others
